# Using Automatic Pattern Recognition to Study DNA Repair in U2OS Cells

This research was conducted at the [UCSD Cellular Biophotonics Laboratory](http://robolase.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Research/) under the mentorship of Dr. Michael Berns & Dr. Linda Shi.


Research Goal: In the lab, lasers are used to cut U2OS cells (from human bone tissue) and form double strand breaks. When the cell is damaged, many proteins with different roles come to the site of damage to repair the cells. Our goal is to use machine learning and image processing to automate the process of detecting laser cut lines in U2OS cells (human bone cells) using MATLAB.
